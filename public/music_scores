      "description": "Peter Graham's Ad Optimum â€“ To the Highest, written for the Star Lake Music Camp in 1999, is the composer's response to the memory of witnessing James Williams conducting Eric Leidzen's None Other Name at Star Lake in 1985. A setting of three hymn tunes, Laudes Domini, The Name of Jesus and Richmond, it provides a rousing finale to an interesting piece that is characteristic of this composer's style.",
